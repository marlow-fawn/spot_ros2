# Overview
This is a ROS2 package for BostonDynamics' Spot. The package contains all necessary topics, services and actions to teleoperate or navigate Spot.
This package is derived of this [ROS1 package](https://github.com/heuristicus/spot_ros). This package currently corresponds to version 3.2.0 of the [spot-sdk](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

## Prerequisites
    - Tested for Ubuntu 22.04 + Humble

## Install
In your ROS2 workspace `src` directory, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spot_ros2.git
```
and initialize and install the submodules
```bash
cd spot_ros2
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then run the install script. The install script takes the optional argument ```--arm64```; it otherwise defaults to an AMD64 install. Run the correct command based on your system 
```bash
cd <path to spot_ros2>
./install_spot_ros2.sh
or
./install_spot_ros2.sh --arm64
```
From here, set up the ROS2 workspace
```
cd <ros2 ws>
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/local_setup.bash
```

## Example Code
See the [examples](examples/) for some examples of using the ROS2 driver.

## Launch
The spot login data hostname, username and password can either be specified as ROS parameters or as environment variables.  If using ROS parameters, see `spot_driver/config/spot_ros_example.yaml` for an example of what your file could look like.  If using environment variables, define `BOSDYN_CLIENT_USERNAME`, `BOSDYN_CLIENT_PASSWORD`, and `SPOT_IP`.

### Model
    ros2 launch spot_description description.launch.py

### SpotDriver
    ros2 launch spot_driver spot_driver.launch.py [config_file:=<path to your ROS config file>] [has_arm:=<True|False>] [spot_name:=<Name of Spot running the driver>] [launch_rviz:=<True|False>] 

### Depth image to Pointcloud2
    ros2 launch spot_driver point_cloud_xyz.launch.py

### Command Line Example Node
The `command_spot_driver` node contains service and action clients. To send a trajectory goal execute:

    ros2 run spot_driver command_spot --ros-args -p command:=trajectory

### Spot CAM Usage
Due to known issues with the Spot CAM, it is disabled by default. To enable publishing and usage over the driver, add the following command in your configuration YAML file:
    `initialize_spot_cam: True`

### Spot CAM Known Issues
The Spot CAM payload has known issues with the SSL certification process in https. If you get the following errors:

![image](https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spot_ros2/assets/137220849/a2d8e248-ab4f-494b-b431-82adc7acf25d)

Then you want to log into the Spot CAM over the browser. In your browser, type in:

    https://<ip_address_of_spot>:<sdp_port>/h264.sdp.html

The default port for SDP is 31102 for the Spot CAM. Once inside, you will be prompted to log in using your username and password. Do so and the WebRTC frames should begin to properly stream.


### Multiple Robots
If you want to use multiple robots, use the `spot_driver_with_namespace` launch file:

    ros2 launch spot_driver_with_namespace.py spot_name:=<spot name> config_file:=<path to your ROS config file>

This will launch all nodes in the `spot_name` namespace and use `spot_name/` as the prefix for all frames.

## Advanced Install

### Install spot_msgs as a deb package
`spot_msgs` are normally compiled as part of this repository.  If you would prefer to install them as a debian package, follow the steps below:
```bash
wget -q -O /tmp/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spot_ros2/releases/download/spot_msgs-v0.0-0/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb
rm /tmp/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb
```

### Install bosdyn_msgs from source
The `bosdyn_msgs` package is installed as a debian package as part of the `install_spot_ros2` script because it's very large.  It can be checked out from source [here](https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/bosdyn_msgs) and then built as a normal ROS2 package if that is preferred (compilation takes about 15 minutes).

## Contributing
To contribute, install `pre-commit` via pip, run `pre-commit install` and then run `pre-commit run --all-files` to 
verify that your code will pass inspection. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spot_ros2.git
cd spot_ros2
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Now whenever you commit code to this repository, it will be checked against our `pre-commit` hooks. You can also run
`git commit --no-verify` if you wish you commit without checking against the hooks.
